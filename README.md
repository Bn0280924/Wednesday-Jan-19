We will do these problems together in class:

 

1. Use a while loop to add up all the numbers from 1 to 100 and print the result

2. Do the first problem, but use a for loop instead

3. Use a list to store each running total from problem 2, and print the numbers in a second for loop

 

Students complete the following programming challenge on their own:

Remember that each character in a string in python has an ascii value. Ask the user for a word using input() and print out whether the sum of the ascii values of the characters is even or odd.

For example, the ascii values of ‘dog’ are 100, 111, and 103. Add them together and we get 314, which is even.
